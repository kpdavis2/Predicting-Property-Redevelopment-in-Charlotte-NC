This project aims to predict the probability of a parcel redevloping in the next five years. We tested several models for this project. This file contains our random forest model, which performed the best. We made a map to visualize the results of the model which can be found [here](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/a4fd282ef8924442a7786664b03836f5#data_s=id%3AdataSource_1-18f1156ebb8-layer-4%3A388465).
